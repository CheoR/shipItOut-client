# Project

ShipItOut is my full stack NSS C46 capstone project. It is related to my initial project, [PackItUp](https://github.com/CheoR/pack-it-up). ShipItOut consist of React front-end and Django backend. It is a dashboard-like app that tracks shipping containers where the shipper, container, port authorities can update the container status as it moves.
